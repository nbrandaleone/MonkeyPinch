Example of using Apple's iOS UIGestureRecognizer (programmatically and IB)

This project shows how to use UIGestureRecognizer, both programmatically and using IB.
Based upon tutorial: http://www.raywenderlich.com/76020/using-uigesturerecognizer-with-swift-tutorial.
I did not implement any custom gestures, only standard ones.
